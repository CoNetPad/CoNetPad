Meeting Minutes for October 15, 2012

1) Made major changes in design:
   
   a) The server will listen on a single port and will manually spawn a thread for each client that connects to it.
   b) Client/Server no longer communicate tasks using an executable (runnable/callable) task object.
        i) Send only plain-text parameters as a string (using delimiters) that specify a particular task
       ii) Client/Server should construct the task object on their own side, based on these parameters.
      iii) Client/Server will then forward the task object to the appropriate ExecutorService.
      	   * Client will forward it to clientExecutor
	   * Server will forward it to the appropriate ServerSourceFile's taskSerializer (a single-thread ExecutorService)
       iv) CNPTask no longer needs to contain a CNPConnection (these will be stored on each side after a client connects)
   c) the permissionType field of a CNPTask should be static

2) We should also work on converting documentation to a plain-text format, whenever possible.
   This way, changes can be made more easily and version differences are simpler to view.

3) TODO: Interface specification needs to be updated.
