Meeting Minutes for October 16, 2012

1) Will no longer use IRC component. CNPServer will handle chat functionality on its own.
   - Note: This means clients can no longer connect to chat server with external IRC
           client.

2) Messages should be passed between client/server using JSON.
   - Note: For now, can use basic string parsing.
           Eventually, should reuse Java JSON library.
