Meeting Minutes for September 27, 2012

1) Discussed the remaining tasks that need to be done for Deliverable II
   a) explanation of the architecture of the system
   b) UML design documents
      i)    class diagram
      ii)   sequence diagram
      iii)  use case diagram(s)
   c) ER diagram / relational schema
   d) test plan
   e) updated risk management
   f) updated project plan

2) use case diagram specifics
   * actors: user (self), users (other than self), IRC server (optional; only if feature allowing connecting to external IRC server is implemented)
   * use cases:
   ** download source/binary
   ** login/create account
   ** create/delete/modify files
   ** edit user settings
   ** chat
   ** clone Git repo
   ** compile source

3) specific classes that will likely be used
   * for the server:
   ** Repository
   ** Account
   ** Session
   ** Compiler
   ** IRCServer
   ** Server
   ** CommandQueue
   * for the client:
   ** UI

   *** ServerConnection
   *** IRCConnection
   ** User // may or may not have an associated Account
   ** IRCCommand
   * shared classes:
   ** SSLSocket
   ** File
   *** ServerFile
   *** ClientFile
   // Note: these are tentative - will likely change as we progress in the design process

4) specific information that the SQLite database will likely need to handle
   * user information
   ** userid
   ** username
   ** password // hashed
   ** user-specific salt
   ** database-wide salt
   
5) specifics on architecture:

		      IRC
		    /
   client -- server -- SQLite
   	  \   	    \
	   --------- Git

   * 3 tier system
   * client-server relationship between all directly connected components

6) Plan/Assignments:
   * we plan to meet at 9am on Tuesday, for whoever can make it (Cesar and Josh confirmed)
   * individual goals for Tuesday:
   ** Josh - class diagram, system architecture, and updated project plan (also will try to finalize the SRS)
   ** Cesar - sequence diagram, use case diagrams, updated risk management, and test plan
   ** Justin - ER diagram, relational schema, user interface layout/design
   * the overall goal is to get the majority of Deliverable II done by Thursday
