Meeting Minutes for October 23, 2012

1) No longer need a Java interface for the client/server. The JSON API will serve as the interface.
   (Still need to explicitly define the API.)

2) Will use GSON as Java JSON library. Will use both JUnit (for unit testing) and some form of functional testing. 

3) Will introduce Network class to abstract network aspect of system. Probably will have an abstract Network class
   which is extended by a ClientNetwork and ServerNetwork classes.
